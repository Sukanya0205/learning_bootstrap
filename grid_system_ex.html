                        <p>A little duck, also called a duckling, is the young one of a duck. Ducklings are small,
                            fluffy, and usually yellow or brown in color. They are born from eggs and can walk, swim,
                            and follow their mother soon after hatching. Ducklings love water and often swim in ponds,
                            lakes, and rivers. They feed on insects, small plants, seeds, and grains. A mother duck
                            protects her ducklings from danger and teaches them how to find food. As they grow,
                            ducklings slowly lose their soft feathers and develop into adult ducks.
                            A little duck, known as a duckling, is the young offspring of a duck. Ducklings are usually
                            born with soft, fluffy feathers that help keep them warm. They hatch from eggs after about
                            28 days of incubation. Soon after birth, ducklings are able to walk, swim, and follow their
                            mother, which is a special survival ability. They are social animals and often stay close
                            together in groups. Ducklings communicate using soft chirping sounds. Their diet includes
                            insects, worms, small fish, grass, seeds, and aquatic plants, which helps them grow strong.
                            As they mature, their feathers change, and they gradually learn to fly and live
                            independently.
